# K-Means

1. The file hw3.dat contains a set of 2D data points (each row of the text file)

2. Implement k-means algorithm to cluster the data into k = 2, 3, 4 and 5 clusters. Your code should show the final cluster results using Matplotlib and report the k-means objective function $\Sigma$$\Sigma$ || x<sub>j</sub> - $\mu$<sub>i</sub> ||<sup>2</sup> , i.e., the total distance of all data to their corresponding cluster centers.
