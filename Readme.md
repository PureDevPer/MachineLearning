## K-means

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7.2-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

Groups of objects that are

- Internal tightness within group
- External separation between groups

## Linear Discriminant Analysis

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7.2-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

A generalization of a method to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.
The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality recution

## Linear Least Square Regression

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7.2-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

The simplest and most commonly applied form of linear regression, which provides a solution to the problem of finding the best fitting straight line through a set of points.

## Logistic Regression

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7.2-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

A statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist

## Principal Component Analysis

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7.2-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

- Determine the form of the low dimensional representation
- Define a criterion to measure the quality of approximation
  - Training: Optimize on data set to minimize the criterion
  - Testing: Project new datum on the low dimensional representation
