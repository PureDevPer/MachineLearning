The goal of this project was to use Neural Networks to recognize handwritten digits and characters using the eMNIST hand-written dataset. We used 6 different methods to build the neural network models and then calculated their prediction accuracy. The eMNIST dataset has 47 hand-written characters including 10 digits (0~9), 26 lower case letters, and 11 capital letters. The algorithms included

- single-layer SoftMax Logistic Regression
- multi-layer Artificial Neural Network
- ANN with Xavier Initialization
- ANN with Dropout
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Ensemble Neural Network.

Ensemble Neural Network was found to have the highest accuracy.
